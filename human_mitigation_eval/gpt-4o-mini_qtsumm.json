In total, there is a normal pattern of more floors with more height, but different ceiling heights and building design can make different height for building that having same or less floors.",

However, this relationship is not always linear. For instance, the Arts Tower is shorter than the Vitri Tower but has more floors. Additionally, some buildings with similar heights, such as Ocean Two and F&F Tower, have significantly different floor counts (73 vs. 52, respectively).

The Arts Tower, which has a height of 265 m, has a floor count of 56 and 80, making it taller than some buildings with fewer floors. Additionally, buildings like Ocean Two (245.7 m, 73 floors) and F&F Tower (242.9 m, 52 floors) illustrate that buildings of similar heights can have significantly different floor counts.
